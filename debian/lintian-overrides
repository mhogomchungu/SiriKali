# "The maintainer script seems to call killall. Since this utility kills
# processes by name, it may well end up killing unrelated processes.
# Most uses of killall should use invoke-rc.d instead."
#
# sysvinit is not an option here, and the call is against
# /usr/bin/siricali, which is unlikely to accidentally hit another
# process.
